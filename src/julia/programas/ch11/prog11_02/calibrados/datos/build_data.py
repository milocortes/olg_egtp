### Calcula alpha --> capital share in production
# Labour-income share --> (labsh : Share of labour compensation in GDP at current national prices)

### Calcula Omega (normaliza w = 1)
## w = (1 - alpha) * Omega * (K/L)**alpha
## Omega = (w/(1 - alpha))/((K/L)**alpha)

K_Y = (df["cn"]/df["cgdpo"]).values[0]

### Calcula tasa de depreciaciÃ³n
## I/Y = (np + delta)(K/Y) ---> delta = (I/Y)/(K/Y) - np  
delta = ((df["csh_i"]/(K_Y/5)) - df["np"])**(1/5)


### Calcula nu --> is the parameter which governs the preference of the household for consumption as compared to leissure
"""
The autors set nu equal to 0.335, which leads labour hours to average at approximately one third of the time endowment

This share is derived from assuming a maximum weekly working-time endowment of 110 hours as well as 50 working weeks per year. 
We relate this average annual working hours per employee of around 1800.

nu = 1800/(110*50)
